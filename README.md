WPM Typing Test in jQuery

A simple app written in jQuery. Compares keypress events against the text prompt by positions in two arrays, increasing the error count if anything does not match. There is no timer, to reduce pressure; instead, the user may end the test when they have typed as many characters that are in the prompt, then presses enter. Errors count against the adjusted WPM score.
